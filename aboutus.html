         <h2>About Us</h2>
         <HR>
        <p> 
            Hear Her Out is a social organization dedicated to give females a voice and an environment to talk about the abuse and violence they have been facing. The organization strives to raise awareness of issues such as sexual assault, harassment, rape etc., that have been happening within our circles and neighbourhood.
        
          
                It is for survivors of violence who are in need of a voice. A voice that needs to be heard in order to raise awareness and strengthen security to lessen sexual assault and harassment that has been happening within our circles. 
              
               
                We want to give females, especially our age, a space to talk about the issues they are facing. As it is a very critical and sensitive topic, they can do it anonymously through our google form that has been marketed on our social media and around the university campus. 

                 We are currently focused on expanding in Leeds and Delhi, However we will be working on expanding to other universities as well.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 <strong>The key idea behind story sharing is that it can be healing, calming, and therapeutic. It brings awareness to others about sexual violence that happens so often and is often overlooked. Lastly, it strengthens the security in society. This organization currently also provides knowledge about consent, sexual assault vs sexual harassment, domestic abuse etc. to educate about the offenses.</strong>

        <h2>Our Goals for the Future</h2>
   
        <p>For the future, we are planning to being potential keynote speakers, that have already been lined up for webinars, from UCLA, Stanford, and Delhi University to talk about violence against women and girls. In addition to that we are in the process of collaborating with other foundations and NGOS.
            <BR>
            <br>
        Lastly, in the near future and our main goal for this organisation is to provide free therapy sessions for the survivors by partnering online with licensed therapy organisations. There are many girls of our age who are ashamed to talk about the traumatizing experience they faced with their parents and they are looked down upon for starting therapy, they feel unheard and thus, we want to bring therapy sessions for them to be able to feel like their voice is heard.
        <br>
        <br>
        The next steps for this organisation would be to market the "Story form" to as many people as possible so they can have access to voice their experiences anonymously. Along with that, we plan on gathering volunteers to outreach and reach out to guest speakers for interactive and influential interviews. Lastly, we want to research and plan fundraising and establish partnerships with therapy organizations.

        <h2>Stories by Survivors</h2>
    
        <p>Story 1: "I was assaulted in my room when I was in my first year by a person who I thought was my friend. I overdosed on my antidepressants that night. I blacked out. I don't remember anything until I woke up with him next to me. I was too scared to say anything since the guy was a supposed friend of mine". (anonymous)
 
            Place - Leeds, United Kingdom
            </p>

        <p>Story 2: "I was sexually assaulted by my tuition teacher. He was a well-renounced tuition teacher in my apartment complex and used to teach many of my guy friends. The parents of the children he used to teach used to tell my mother how good of a teacher he was and after being taught by him, their children got over 95% marks on papers. Even my guy friends used to tell me how good of a teacher he was. So hearing all this, my mum got him to teach me too, But for some reason, he was.... different from me. While my guy friends used to tell me how strict of a teacher he is, when he came to my house to teach me, he was playful with me, telling me he would give me chocolates if I answered a question right and such. I found it odd but just thought that maybe he took a liking to me. But one afternoon, when he teaching me, he grabbed my arm for some reason, and he held my arm such that his fingers were pressing and touching my breasts, and he kept his hand like that for at least 5 minutes while he continued teaching me a sum, he kept his hand like that even when I tried to squirm away and whenever I tried to squirm away his hand grabbing my arm got tighter, and his fingers kept pressing on my breasts.

            No one in their sane mind won't notice that they are holding a girl in a wrong away, so it was 101% not a mistake, it was fully intentional. I never said anything to him but i did went to my mother and told her about this which resulted in him being told that I don't need a tution anymore and him never coming to my house every again. But except my parents no one believes me that i was wrongly touched by the teacher, that i was sexually assaulted by him, everyone just kept telling my mother that i must have gotten the wrong idea, that he must have not realised and that it was purely a mistake, that i was wrong because he was such a reputable teacher in my apartment complex who made his students get top marks in class therefore he was not capable of doing such a thing. I was a minor at this time, 14 yrs old."
            
            
            Place - Her home
        </p>

        <p>Story 3: My final exams were coming, my tuition teacher took extra classes. So it used to be 7 pm approx when I got home, and it used to be a little dark than usual, as it was the month of Feb. That day, I took the shortcut to home, which is usually a little dark and silent route, though there were houses around. I was going that way, and 1 boy passed me and went in the opposite direction. Then he came back in my direction and told me that someone was calling me, and I said I don't see anyone, but he again told me that someone was calling me from that side and me being a little bit naive, I went that way to see who was there, but there was no one, and I was about to tell that to him, but...he suddenly grabs my mouth and my thighs from behind. I screamed so much, but no one was there to hear me. He then kissed me on the cheek and ran away. I was so angry about this situation because I couldn't do anything to save myself. I went home and then straight to the washroom, and I started crying. After that, I told my mom what happened, so after that, she used to go drop me off and pick me up every day. THIS HAPPENED WHEN I WAS IN 7TH CLASS, I WAS 12 YEARS OLD.

        </p>
        <p>Story 4: I was five years old. I had just moved to another country. There was this caretaker who used to work at our house. One day I was in my room playing with my toys when he came in and asked me to pose for a picture. I posed and smiled, and then he asked me to lay down saying he wants a picture of my laying down so I did as he said. Once I did he came on top of me and started moving his body up and down, I guess kind of like grinding on top of me but I didn’t really understand much of what was happening. And then he started kissing me, all I remember thinking was he smells bad and that I don’t like what’s happening, but I just lay there waiting for it to be over. This turned into a very frequent thing and I just didn’t know how to stop it. I wouldn’t resist and I never said no, until one day he asked me to and I finally said no I don’t want to. I don’t like it when you kiss me and to that he replied it’s okay I won’t kiss you just lay down. I said no again and told him I will tell my mom that you kiss me and in a fit I ran upstairs to my mother who was resting and told her what had been happening. She confronted him about it and he had the audacity to say that I was like his daughter and he could never think about doing that. I think this incident had a great impact on my personality. I was scared to approach men for a long time and would feel uncomfortable talking to a man. I also developed stage fright and would hate it when the spotlight was on me. I am 21 years old now and have started to gain back my confidence and although this was not ideal, I am glad to be able to share this story and hopefully show other victims that it is possible to grow into a stronger and better version of yourself.
